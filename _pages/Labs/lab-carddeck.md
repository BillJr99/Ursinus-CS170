In this lab, we will practice writing `for` loops using the `range` function to iterate over decks of cards, and then use a loop to simulate the effects of monthly credit card debt.

## What to Do

### Part 1: Card Deck

The `range` function takes two forms:

* `range(N)`: generates all values from `0` to `N-1`
* `range(start, end)`: generates all values from `start` to `end-1`

Write a `for` loop that loops 4 times over a variable called `i`.  Inside this loop, loop from all values between `1` and `14` (inclusive) over a variable called `j`.

Within the inner loop, check the value of `i`.  If it is `0`, set a `suit` variable to `Clubs`.  Do this for each of the remaining values, for `Hearts`, `Diamonds`, and `Spades`.

Then, check the value of `j`.  If it is 11, set a variable `card` to `Jack`.  Similarly, set `card` to `Queen` for `12`, `King` for `13`, and `Ace` for 14.  If the value is anything else, just set `card` to that value (the numeric card value).

Finally, print the value of the card.  When you run this program, you should see all 52 cards in the "deck."

### Part 2: Credit Card Debt Simulator

In a separate program, loop over each of 12 months.  Within each simulated month, ask the user how much money they paid off by the due date, and subtract this from their prior balance.  

Next, if their balance is greater than 0, charge an interest rate of 6% to their **original** balance (not the amount after making the payment!  Be careful not to subtract from the balance right away so that you maintain their current balance, or save the old balance in a separate variable).  

Then, ask them how much money they spent on their credit card.  Add this value to their running balance, and repeat.

After the loop has ended, print out the total amount they spent over the 12 months, and how much money they paid back in interest.  You'll need additional variables to keep track of these running totals in your loop!

## What to Turn In

When you're done, write a README for your project, and save all your files, before exporting your project to ZIP.  **In your README, answer any bolded questions presented on this page.**  In addition, write a few paragraphs describing what you did, how you did it, and how to use your program.  If your program requires the user to type something in, describe that here.  If you wrote functions to help solve your problem, what are they, and what do they do?  Imagine that you are giving your program to another student in the class, and you want to explain to them how to use it.  What would you tell them?  Imagine also that another student had given you the functions that you wrote for your program: what would you have wished that you knew about how to call those functions?
