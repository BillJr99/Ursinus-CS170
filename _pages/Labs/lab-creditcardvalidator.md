## What to Do
Write a program to input a credit card number into a variable as a string of text.  Loop over every character in the credit card number variable **except** for the very last one, and if the index is odd, double the value at that location (otherwise, just keep the number as-is).  Add all the numbers together.

The ones digit of this sum should be equal to the last digit in the credit card number.  Use the modulus operator to get the ones digit, and check if it equals the last digit in the credit card number.  Print out whether or not they match.

### Example

For example, suppose our credit card number is `5555555555554444`.  We can loop over each character in this string.  If it is in an odd position (like the second `5`, which is in index position `1`), we can double it.  Convert each digit to an `int` so you can double the values!  From this, we get the following numbers:

Add these values together.  For two digit values (like 16), we can convert the value back to a string, loop over its characters, convert them to `int`, and add them up.  From these, we get the following values:

```
5
10
5 
10
5
10
5 
10
5
10
5 
10
4
8
4
8
```

Adding these values together, we get 114.  Take this number and mod it by 10, which obtains 4.  This should match the last digit of the string, which it does!  You can compare your calculated check digit and the last digit of the credit card string using an `if` statement.  Just be sure to convert the last character of the credit card number to an `int` before you compare, so that you can compare it to your calculated integer value.

### Helpful Functions

#### Looping over a string with its index

You can loop over each character of a string called `str` like this:

```python
for i in range(len(str)):
    ch = str[i]
    # i is the position number of the character (the index)
    # ch is the character itself
```

#### Converting a character to an integer

You can convert a character to an integer using the `int` function:

```python
x = int(x)
```

### Extra Credit (10%): Adding the Individual Digits
Some credit cards add the individual digits together.  So, after multiplying by 2, if you get 12, you add 1 + 2 instead of 12.  To do this, convert the value back to a string using:

```python
ch = str(ch)
```

And loop over those characters (like before), adding them to the sum instead.

### Extra Credit (10%): argv
Modify your program to get the credit card number from `sys.argv`.  `sys.argv` is an array of command line arguments.  `sys.argv[0]` is the name of the program itself, and subsequent arguments are those you type in at the console when you run the program.  Normally, when you click the run button, the shell runs:

`python yourprogram.py`

But you can do this manually by typing

`python creditcard.py 1234567890123456`

which will place `1234567890123456` into `sys.argv[1]`.  Be sure to import the `sys` library and if the length of this array is at least 2, use `sys.argv[1]`.  Otherwise, use the `input` function to get the credit card number like before.  Run the program from the command line.  This is a convenient way to bypass having to pause your program to wait for user input!

## What to Turn In

When you're done, write a README for your project, and save all your files, before exporting your project to ZIP.  **In your README, answer any bolded questions presented on this page.**  In addition, write a few paragraphs describing what you did, how you did it, and how to use your program.  If your program requires the user to type something in, describe that here.  If you wrote functions to help solve your problem, what are they, and what do they do?  Imagine that you are giving your program to another student in the class, and you want to explain to them how to use it.  What would you tell them?  Imagine also that another student had given you the functions that you wrote for your program: what would you have wished that you knew about how to call those functions?
