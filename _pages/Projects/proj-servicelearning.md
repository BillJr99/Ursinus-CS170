In this project, you will propose a topic of your choosing and a group of at least 1 and up to 2 total members.  The project must be approved by the instructor before it may commence, but the topic is entirely up to you.  

This open-ended project aims to give you space to explore computing and its applications in a context that you're passionate about.  The full capability of computing to benefit others is realized when it is applied to domains of human need.  A theme of this project is to expand your view of computing and its capabilities in service to others.  There are perhaps endless ways of doing this.  Here are some examples:

* Designing a lesson plan for K-12 students to get exposed to computing in an area related to your major (or other interest!)
* Interviewing a technical professional related to your own major or area of interest about the role of computing in their life
* Producing a podcast episode about the role of computing in society (for instance, about how humans can be better engaged by technical professionals to facilitate more accessible technologies)
* A research report on computing privacy considerations

## Group Formation and Proposal (20 Points)

To form a group, students should draft a text document including the names of all students in the group, a summary of the proposed project, and a breakdown of each student's responsibilities on the team.  **Each student** should send this identical document to me for approval via e-mail.  I will respond via e-mail to the **entire** group notifying them that the project has been approved, and which members are on the team.  If I add or remove members from the team, I will notify the entire group via e-mail.  This shall constitute agreement of the project responsibilities by all members of the team.

Students who do not submit the proposal document described above (even if they are named in another group's proposal) by the proposal deadline will be assigned to a group and notified via e-mail.  Students will not receive credit for the proposal in this situation.

Should a member of the team fail to participate to the standards set in the proposal document described above, one or more members of the group shall notify that student via e-mail of specific tasks from the proposal document that have been agreed to, along with a deadline to communicate with the group (copy me on the e-mail message).  If the student does not respond within 2 days of that message, the group should notify me via e-mail, and I will investigate and, if appropriate, I may re-organize the team by moving one or more members to other groups (whom I will notify via e-mail), or by removing the student from the group (whom I will notify via e-mail).  

## First Draft (30 Points)

It is best if one's first draft is not also the final draft, especially as your ideas evolve with your own understanding and from feedback from others.  The first draft is an opportunity to write your ideas: concentrate on your message, rather than the structure of your narrative.  How do you want your readers to change after having read your work?  What contribution are you hoping to make?  Don't worry if it's not entirely clear in this draft, or if the organization isn't perfect.  At this stage, you are developing your raw materials - the clay from which you'll mold a cohesive thesis later.

## Final Draft (50 Points)

It is **highly recommended** that you review your first draft with a [Writing Fellow from the Writing and Speaking Center](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/center-for-writing-and-speaking/).  Based on this feedback and the feedback from your instructor (and possibly from classmates), revise your report into a final draft.
