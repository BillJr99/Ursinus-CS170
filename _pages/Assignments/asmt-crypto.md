      description: Algorithm Implementation
      preemerging: The algorithm fails on the test inputs due to major issues, or the program fails to compile and/or run
      beginning: The algorithm fails on the test inputs due to one or more minor issues
      progressing: The algorithm is implemented to solve the problem correctly according to given test inputs, but would fail if executed in a general case due to a minor issue or omission in the algorithm design or implementation
      proficient: A reasonable algorithm is implemented to solve the problem which correctly solves the problem according to the given test inputs, and would be reasonably expected to solve the problem in the general case

      description: Code Indentation and Spacing
      preemerging: Code indentation and spacing are generally inappropriate or inconsistent
      beginning: Code indentation or spacing are generally appropriate but inconsistent in a few isolated instances
      progressing: Code indentation or spacing are appropriate or consistent, with minor adjustments needed
      proficient: Code indentation and spacing are appropriate and consistent
    - weight: 10
      description: Code Quality
      preemerging: Prior code quality feedback and style guide standards are not reflected in the submitted code to a great extent
      beginning: Code quality conforms to several standards in the course Style Guide, and progress is demonstrated in improving code quality from prior feedback
      progressing: Code quality conforms to the standards in the course Style Guide to a great extent, with a few identified areas of improvement
      proficient: Code quality substantially conforms to the standards in the course Style Guide
    - weight: 10
      description: Code Documentation
      preemerging: Code commenting and structure are absent, or code structure departs significantly from best practice
      beginning: Code commenting and structure is limited in ways that reduce the readability of the program; specifically, javadoc style comments are present for some functions
      progressing: Code documentation is present that re-states the explicit code definitions
      proficient: Code is documented at non-trivial points in a manner that enhances the readability of the program; specifically, javadoc style comments are present for all functions
    - weight: 10
      description: Writeup and Submission
      preemerging: An incomplete submission is provided, or the README file submitted is blank
      beginning: The program is submitted, but not according to the directions in one or more ways (for example, because it is lacking a readme writeup or missing answers to written questions)
      progressing: The program is submitted according to the directions with a minor omission or correction needed, including a readme writeup describing the solution and answering nearly all questions posed in the instructions
      proficient: The program is submitted according to the directions, including a readme writeup describing the solution and answering all questions posed in the instructions
